# Constitution of The Federal Republic of Discordia

## Article I.

The legislative power shall be vested into two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate.

### Section 1

House representatives will be voted in directly by the people of the state. Voters will each have the amount of votes as there are positions open and will be able to use each vote for a different candidate. The people with the most votes will assume the positions. This shall be done through Republic Manager (968351789931954196).

The House of Representatives will be comprised of representatives proportional to the number of citizens currently residing in the FRD, and elected every 2 weeks by the people of each state.

The actual enumeration of the people living therein will be completed within 4 weeks of the first session of Congress and will be recounted every 6 weeks. Until the actual enumeration, there will be 1 representative for every 2 people in each state. 

No person who has not been a citizen of the FRD for at least 1 week, who has been convicted of a high crime or misdemeanor, or barred from office by a federal court shall be a representative.

The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker and other officers.

The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment, which may be used against an official of another branch in cases of high crimes, misdemeanors, or failure to carry out the duties of the position.

In the case of a vacancy in the House of Representatives, the executive authority of the State whose Representative is no longer in office shall have the power to issue writs of Election to fill said vacancies for the remainder of the term.

### Section 2

The Senate shall be composed of 2 senators for each of the states, elected every 6 weeks by the people of each state.

Immediately following the first election to the Senate, the senators will be divided into 3 groups at random. The 1st group shall serve for 2 weeks, the 2nd shall serve for 4 weeks, and the 3rd shall serve for 6 weeks. After these terms, the standard 6 week term will come into effect.

No person who has not been a citizen of the FRD for at least 2 weeks, who does not currently reside in the state they would represent, who has been convicted of a high crime or misdemeanor, or barred from office by a federal court shall be a senator.

The Vice-President will be the President of the Senate but will have no vote unless they are equally divided.

The Senate shall choose its officers, and a President pro tempore, who shall serve as the President when the Vice President is not present.

The Senate shall have the power to try all impeachment. When the President or Vice President is being tried, the Chief Justice of the FRD will preside. With two thirds concurrence of all senators, the officer will be convicted. Conviction by the Senate will result in the removal of the officer from office. On conviction, the Senate may also choose to disqualify the officer from being able to again hold federal office.

In the case of a vacancy in the Senate, the executive authority of the State whose Senator is no longer in office shall have the power to issue writs of Election to fill said vacancies for the remainder of the term.
